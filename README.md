# American Gods: The Road Trip

*American Gods: The Road Trip* is the minimum viable project for a mobile-first web application of what is essentially a fan site,
 with a twist, for the bestselling Neil Gaiman novel *American Gods*. The novel is an urban fantasy in which the protagonist, 
 Shadow, drives from one US town to the next in order to aid his boss, Wednesday / Odin, in rallying the gods of old, pagan, 
 religions for a war against the gods of the new world, the latter being personifications of media, technology, etc. Since the
 publication of the novel, an increasing number of its fans have attempted to recreate the journey that Shadow makes by going on 
 similar road trips in the US. Additionally, more fans have discovered *American Gods* and become interested in recreating the 
 road trip since the novel was adapted into an internationally successful television show and a bestselling graphic novel series.

*American Gods: The Road Trip* will be a must-visit website for any fan of the novel or TV show and anyone either considering or 
currently undertaking a road trip based on either.

The full site is deployed via GitHub Pages at: https://rossclarkscotland.github.io/Milestone2/index.html

## UX

NOTE: A full user experience design document, detailing the five planes of design for *American Gods: The Road Trip* appears 
as a separate document. The UX section in this document provides an overview.

*American Gods: The Road Trip* assists fans both in enriching their experience of the novel / TV show by providing information
about the locations in which the events take place and by helping to plan / make road trips based on the tale by providing route
maps and information on how to find accommodation, eating opportunities, and tourist sights in each town. Additionally, music is
a strong motif that has captured the imagination of many readers of *American Gods*, with Neil Gaiman referencing over 50 songs
throughout the novel. The website affords readers an opportunity to easily access all of these songs.

In its present form, *American Gods: The Road Trip* is designed for a post-COVID 19 world, in which tourism has largely returned to
normality. However, should the current situation persist in the long-term, the site&#39;s &quot;Places&quot; page enables users to
discover the locations in the novel virtually via Google Maps. In a long-term COVID context the site could be modified to focus 
more on a virtual tour, using, for example, the Google Street View Static API or, at a more advanced level, by integrating augmented
reality software, such as that offered by Mapbox ([https://www.mapbox.com/augmented-reality/](https://www.mapbox.com/augmented-reality/)).

**User stories**

User story 1:

&quot;As someone reading *American Gods* right now, I&#39;d love to know more about all the locations in the novel so I can really put
myself in Shadow&#39;s shoes as I read.&quot;

User story 2:

&quot;As a huge fan of *American Gods*, I&#39;ve wanted to make a road trip based on the novel for a long time and I&#39;d really like 
information on how to plan that trip.&quot;

User story 3:

&quot;As someone currently making a road trip based on *American Gods*, I really need information on where to stay and eat, as well as
on what to do, in each place I visit.&quot;

User story 4:

memories of the book.&quot;

**Features: Existing features**

**All pages**

- The navigation bar allows users to easily navigate the pages of the site by giving them a simple site overview. It also contains a 
hover effect, creating a border around the navigation bar the user is currently hovering over, for further clarity.

- As it provides a cleaner aesthetic on smaller devices, the navigation bar appears on the homepage in the form of a hamburger-style
 dropdown menu. However, all other pages contain navigation links as text directly on a banner image at the top of the page. 
 This decision was made both to integrate the Amatic SC font within the integral page design, as the font hints at the playful
 elements of the novel, and to reduce the number of times users need to click to access information, i.e. by not requiring the 
 user to click a burger menu to see the navigation bar before selecting another page.

- The minimalist footer allows users to easily access related social media pages without encroaching on other site content. 
The social media icons in the footer turn to green, matching the green of the aurora borealis on the hero image, whenever a user hovers over them.

**Index.html**

- In addition to the navigation bar and social media footer discussed above, index.html contains an atmospheric background road trip image 
from Pixabay that evokes the journey and supernatural elements of the novel.
- Via media queries, the background image, navigation bar, and page title will change orientation, from portrait to landscape, depending 
on the size of the screen.
- As stated above, index.html contains a hamburger-style dropdown navigation bar on smaller devices for a cleaner aesthetic. The homepage 
navigation changes its design arrangement to make best use of the device on which it appears. For example, on laptops, the homepage image 
appears as a landscape image with the title and sub-title in the Lato font and the navigation links appearing in the top-right corner in 
Amatic SC. The same is true of tablets when index.html is viewed in a landscape view with the device held horizontally. However, when 
index.html is viewed as a portrait image on most tablets, with the device held vertically, 
the homepage utilizes the burger-style menu with the navigation links in the Amatic SC font and the page title and sub-title in Lato. 
For smartphones, the page title appears in Lato, the sub-title in Amatic SC and the navigation links in the burger-style dropdown in Lato, 
given that those links would be less legible when smaller when written in Amatic SC in the dropdown.

**about.html**

- The About page gives visitors an overview of *American Gods* and the purpose of the site.
- An embedded YouTube video, via iframes, gives visitors an opportunity to obtain more information on the *American Gods* road trip directly 
from Neil Gaiman himself.

**quotes.html**

- A JavaScript function enables users to generate a quote from *American Gods* at random, something which is bound to appeal to book lovers, 
especially fans who are invested in this particular novel enough to visit the site.

**route.html**

- Embedded maps, via Google Maps Route Planner, show users how to get from one road trip location to the next based on the order they 
appear in the *American Gods* novel.
- An internal navigation menu allows users to easily navigate to each route map.
- A &#39;Geography Challenge&#39;, powered by the Google Maps JavaScript API, allows users to place nodes on a map of the US in an attempt
 to correctly identify the locations in the novel.
- Users may manipulate any of the embedded maps, e.g. zooming in and out of particular locations. Users are given brief instructions above each 
map to tell them how to interact with it.
- Instructions above each section inform users on how to interact with the maps. These instructions are repeated in each section, i.e. 
rather than simply being stated once at the beginning, to ensure than users receive this information even if they navigate straight 
to a location without reading the introductory page information.
- &#39;Return to top&#39; links return users back to the internal page navigation bar without having to scroll for longer periods.

**places.html**

- This page contains easy-to-access maps and information on accommodation, eateries, and tourist sights for every suggested location on the 
*American Gods* road trip.
- The internal page navigation bar allows users to quickly jump to any of the 24 locations covered on the page 
by providing an inner-page hyperlink to each.
- Each section contains the relevant location, background information on the role this location plays in *American Gods*, maps, and information 
on accommodation, eateries, and tourist sights in the area. Sections begin with a default map showing accommodation in the area, but users may 
change the content of each map, to show either eateries or tourist sights, by clicking one of 3 call to action buttons below each map.
- Users may click the nodes on each map to access information / ratings on each hotel, restaurant, or tourist site by clicking the nodes.
- The &#39;RETURN TO TOP&#39; links after each location allows users to navigate easily back to the inner-page navigation bar without having 
to scroll for long periods.
- Instructions above each section inform users on how to interact with the maps. These instructions are repeated in each section, i.e. 
rather than simply being stated once at the beginning, to ensure than users receive this information even if they navigate straight 
to a location without reading the introductory page information.

**music.html**

- This page affords users an opportunity to easily access all of the songs referenced in *American Gods* via both a link to an external 
article which lists all of the songs in the novel and a &#39;jukebox&#39; on the page which, with the click of a call to action button, 
will select a song from the book at random. An element of gamification is added by framing this within the narrative that the gods from 
the novel have chosen the song for the user.

**game.html**

- This page allows users to play an old-school card battle-type game on the page, whether to kill time on the road trip or just to enhance 
reader&#39;s enjoyment of the novel by allowing them to play as and against characters in the book.
- The game page enables users to play as one of 4 characters by clicking on a character profile.
- Once users choose a character, they find one of 4 opponents by clicking a button at the bottom of the page.
- During the game, users play by pressing one of 3 call to action buttons: &#39;Attack!&#39;, &#39;Retreat!&#39;, or &#39;Go nuclear!&#39;.
- The narrative and events of the game are communicated to users via window alerts, or, for those whose devices block window alerts a &#39;
Scoreboard&#39; at the top of the page, for which the inner HTML changes to to contain the relevant information after each move. In cases
 where devices do allow window alerts, the inner HTML at the top of the page simply acts as a scoreboard and summary of each round of play.

**contact.html**

- This page allows users to contact the site by filling out a contact form, the content of which will link directly to a valid email address 
used by the site administrator.
- A clearly marked call to action button enables users to send their messages.
- The innerHTML of both the page heading and sub-heading change upon form submission
  to inform the user whether or not submission was successful.

## Features: Features left to implement

- An image gallery of photographs taken by site users on their road trips.
- A discussion forum for users to exchange information and advice on travel logistics, where to see, what to do, etc.
- A page which allows users to write reviews of hotels, restaurants, tourist sights, etc.
- A page similar to the current places.html page but which rather uses an API such as Google Street View Static or 
location-based Augmented Reality via Mapbox to enable users to take, albeit limited, virtual tours of specific locations in the novel.
- Develop a social media presence.
- Build a YouTube playlist of all the songs in *American Gods* and link to it / embed it.

## Testing

To ensure that the site contains valid HTML, the HTML code was checked by direct input using the W3C Markup Validation Service: [https://validator.w3.org/](https://validator.w3.org/)

### Notes
- Due to the literary typeface style used to begin most pages, with the first few words large in Amatic SC and the following text
  smaller and in Lato, these sections cannot begin with headings, given that headings necessitate the text following moving to a 
  new line. As such, the HTML validator shows a warning for sections without headings for each relevant page. I checked this with a 
  course tutor and was informed it was not a issue of concern.
- Similarly, some sections in the game.html page do not have headings becuase the innerHTML is only added later via JS functions
  in response to user events. Here, too, the validator shows warnings.

To check valid CSS, direct input via the W3C CSS Validation Service was used: [https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)

To test the validity of the JavaScript used in each of the JavaScript files Espirima, JShint and BeautifyTools were used. 

### Notes
-The JS files pass through Espirima with no warnings. For BeutifyTools and JShint, the larger files must be validated
in separate parts, given that both tools issue warnings for features used in ES6 and stop the validation after a certain
number of these warnings. Both JShint and BeautifyTools also issue warnings for undefined and unused variables; however,
these variables are either: defined in other JS files, used as shortcuts to change innerHTML, function names, or part of
the Google Maps or EmailJS templates.

[http://beautifytools.com/javascript-validator.php](http://beautifytools.com/javascript-validator.php)

To ensure the site&#39;s functionality across various devices, I used the web developer tools inspection feature of each of the following browsers:

- Google Chrome
- Mozilla Firefox
- Microsoft Opera
- Microsift Edge

For each browser, I checked the preview of each of the site's pages for the following devices, in both vertical and horizontal views for mobile devices:

- Kindle Fire HDX
- Laptop with HiDPI screen
- Laptop with MDPI screen
- Laptop with touch
- Moto G4
- Galaxy S5
- Pixel 2
- Pixel 2XL
- iPhone 5/SE
- iPhone 6/7/8
- iPhone 6/7/8 plus
- iPhone X
- iPad
- iPad Pro
- Surface Duo
- Galaxy Fold
- The site has also been checked on developer tools at a width of 3840px / 4k

I manually checked all the pages and features of the website (i.e. navigation, links external and internal, buttons, hover effects, 
embedded video, maps, game, contact form) across all device simulations that each browser offers.

In addition to checking the application&#39;s functionality using browser developer tools, the site has been manually checked and 
found to function as desired on the following devices:

- Laptops:
  - Lenovo Yoga 530 (checked by both myself and my wife, Anita):
  - HP 255 G5 Notebook (checked by both myself and my wife, Anita):
  - Macbook with Safari 13 (checked by my friend Yan)
- Tablets:
  - Kindle Fire 3 HD (checked by both myself and my wife, Anita)
  - iPad mini 3 (checked by my father, George)
- Smartphones:
  - Samsung Galaxy J4+ (checked by myself)
  - Samsung A50 (checked by my wife, Anita)
  - iPhone XR (checked by my brother, Greg)
  - iPhone SE (checked by my friend Ruth)
  - Samsung S7 (checked by my friend Mike)

## Bugs and fixes
- Originally, the results of hitting the ‘Attack!’, ‘Retreat’, and ‘Go nuclear!’ buttons and the announcement of the end of the game were communicated
  to the player only via window alerts. However, test users with pop-ups disabled reported not being able to follow the game. As such, the deployed version
  of the game communicates this information to users by changing the inner HTML on the game interface page accordingly after each round of play.
  The alerts have, however, been retained to add a sense of immediacy to the gameplay for those users whose devices do allow window alerts.
- Originally, the game contained a bug in that after the game was finished users could still hit any of the three buttons and receive alerts regarding
  the results of those moves. This was fixed by adding an 'if' statement at the beginning of each button’s respective JS function which, if either 
  the player’s or the opponent’s health score is at or below zero, sends an alert and to tell the user that the game is 
  over and they must refresh. Upon once the game is over (the innerHTML of the page heading also tells the user who won 
  and instructs them to refresh). The remainders of the original functions are now enclosed in 'else if' statements.
- In some cases, highting the 'Show places to see' butting on places.html resulted in Google Maps showing a map of either the whole world or of the
  region the user was in. On the assumption that the places in question may have been too small for Google Maps to log "tourist attractions" for the area,
  the searches conducted via mapEmbeds.js were amended to search instead for 'parks'.
- Originally, the contact form submission was powered by formspark. However, this led to console errors after submission
  due to inherent errors on the back-end. As such, the formspark was switched out for emailJS.
- Unlike formspark, emailJS does not provide an automatic message telling the user that their form has been submitted,
  which led to both myself and a test user submitting multiple times by mistake. To overcome this, the innerHTML
  of the Contact page heading and sub-heading now change upon the user clicking the 'submit' button to inform them
  whether or not the submission has been successful.
