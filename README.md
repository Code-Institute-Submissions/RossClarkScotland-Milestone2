# American Gods: The Road Trip

_American Gods: The Road Trip_ is the minimum viable project for a mobile-first web application of what is essentially a fan site, with a twist, for the bestselling Neil Gaiman novel _American Gods_. 
The novel is an urban fantasy in which the protagonist, Shadow, drives from one US town to the next in order to aid his boss, Wednesday / Odin, in rallying the gods of old, pagan, religions for a war 
against the gods of the new world, the latter being personifications of media, technology, etc. Since the publication of the novel, an increasing number of its fans have attempted to recreate  journey
that Shadow makes by going on similar road trips in the US. Additionally, more fans have discovered _American Gods_ and become interested in recreating the road trip since the novel was adapted into an
internationally successful television show and a bestselling graphic novel series.

_American Gods: The Road Trip_ will be a must-visit website for any fan of the novel or TV show and anyone either considering or currently undertaking a road trip based on either.

## UX

NOTE: A full user experience design document, detailing the five planes of design for _American Gods: The Road Trip_ appears as a separate document. The UX section in this document provides an overview.

_American Gods: The Road Trip_ assists fans both in enriching their experience of the novel / TV show by providing information about the locations in which the events take place and by helping to plan / make road trips based on the tale by providing route maps and information on how to find accommodation, eating opportunities, and tourist sights in each town. Additionally, music is a strong motif that has captured the imagination of many readers of _American Gods_, with Neil Gaiman referencing over 50 songs throughout the novel. The website affords readers an opportunity to easily access all of these songs.

In its present form, _American Gods: The Road Trip_ is designed for a post-COVID 19 world, in which tourism has largely returned to normality. However, should the current situation persist in the long-term, the site&#39;s &quot;Places&quot; page enables users to discover the locations in the novel virtually via Google Maps. In a long-term COVID context the site could be modified to focus more on a virtual tour, using, for example, the Google Street View Static API or, at a more advanced level, by integrating augmented reality software, such as that offered by Mapbox ([https://www.mapbox.com/augmented-reality/](https://www.mapbox.com/augmented-reality/)).

**Index.html**

- In addition to the navigation bar and social media footer discussed above, index.html contains an atmospheric background road trip image from Pixabay that evokes the journey and supernatural elements of the novel.
- Via media queries, the background image, navigation bar, and page title will change orientation, from portrait to landscape, depending on the size of the screen.

**about.html**

- The About page gives visitors an overview of _American Gods_ and the purpose of the site.
- An embedded YouTube video, via iframes, gives visitors an opportunity to obtain more information on the _American Gods_ road trip directly from Neil Gaiman himself.

**places.html**

- This page contains easy-to-access maps and information on accommodation, eateries, and tourist sights for every suggested location on the _American Gods_ road trip.

- Each section contains the relevant location, background information on the role this location plays in _American Gods_, maps, and information on accommodation, eateries, and tourist sights in the area. Sections begin with a default map showing accommodation in the area, but users may change the content of each map, to show either eateries or tourist sights, by clicking one of 3 call to action buttons below each map.
- Users may click the nodes on each map to access information / ratings on each hotel, restaurant, or tourist site by clicking the nodes.

An element of gamification will be added by framing this within the narrative that the gods from the novel have chosen the song for the user.

**game.html**

- This page allows users to play an old-school card battle-type game on the page, whether to kill time on the road trip or just to enhance reader&#39;s enjoyment of the novel by allowing them to play as and against characters in the book.
- The game page enables users to play as one of 4 characters by clicking on a character profile.
- Once users choose a character, they find one of 4 opponents by clicking a button at the bottom of the page.
- During the game, users play by pressing one of 3 call to action buttons: &#39;Attack!&#39;, &#39;Retreat!&#39;, or &#39;Go nuclear!&#39;.
- The narrative and events of the game will be communicated to users via window alerts or, for those whose devices block window alerts a &#39;Scoreboard&#39; at the top of the page, for which the inner HTML changes to to contain the relevant information after each move.

## Credits

**Content:**

- The linear-gradient method used on the landing page image was based on the design and code used for the CSS project on the following Udemy course (though the image and linear gradient values themselves differ from those on that course): [https://www.udemy.com/course/design-and-develop-a-killer-website-with-html5-and-css3/](https://www.udemy.com/course/design-and-develop-a-killer-website-with-html5-and-css3/)
- The social media link icons code in the footer was adapted from that in the Bootstrap mini project of the User Centric Frontend Development module.
- The code for the &quot;Return to the top of the page&quot; buttons was taken, and slightly adapted, from that given on the following web page: [https://www.computerhope.com/issues/ch001475.htm#:~:text=In%20your%20HTML%20code%2C%20find%20the%20opening%20%3Cbody%3E,you%20back%20to%20the%20top%20of%20the%20page](https://www.computerhope.com/issues/ch001475.htm#:~:text=In%20your%20HTML%20code%2C%20find%20the%20opening%20%3Cbody%3E,you%20back%20to%20the%20top%20of%20the%20page)
- I created the game by adapting from and adding to a game built in the following tutorial: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6sA8fvMCuA&amp;t=1s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6sA8fvMCuA&amp;t=1s)

I also owe a debt to my brother, Greg, for repeatedly agreeing to test and give feedback on site functionality, particularly as regards the various iterations of the game.

I am indebted, too, to my friends Ruth, Yan, and Mike, and to my father, George, for checking the functionality of the website on their devices.

I would also like to thank my friend Milana for offering her expert feedback on all things cartographic and design, and for being a reliable font of telling me when my UX sucks.

Finally, I would like to express my gratitude to my course mentor, Spencer Barribal, for offering encouragement and useful ideas, and to the Code Institute tutors and Slack community for providing advice and for humouring me when I asked stupid questions.
